# Summary

Simple repo to create my own fake data with deno. Used for mocked things if FE for occasional convenience since Mockaroo is quite cumbersome to use sometimes.

# Setup

## Prerequisites

[Deno](https://deno.land)

## Run (no need to install anything)

Note: we accept an argument which should be a number, this will determine the amount of objects to be mocked

```shell
# you can use npm or yarn as well depending on the one you have installed
pnpm start <number>
```
